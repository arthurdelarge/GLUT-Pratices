## Description

This repository contains GLUT practice projects related to:

* 2D Transformation (Scale, rotation and translation)
* Back-Face Detection
* Bezier Curves
* Optimized Circunference (Midpoint circle algorithm)
* Optimized Line
* Orthogonal Projection
* Perspective Projection

## How to Run

### Installation:

1. Install [CodeBlocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/)

2. Copy glut.h and paste it into the directory:
     *"C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include\GL"*

3. Copy glut32.lib and paste it into the directory: *"C:\Program Files(x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\lib"*

4. Copy glut32.dll and paste it into the directories: *"C:\Windows\System32"* and *"C:\Windows\SysWOW64"*

5. Open CodeBlocks

6. Go to Settings -> Compiler -> Toolchain executables.

7. Change Compiler's installation directory to: *"C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW"*

### Opening Project:

1. Go to File -> New -> Project -> 2D/3D Graphics -> GLUT project

2. Create a name and choose project directory

3. In Glut's Location put de directory: *"C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW"*

4. Paste the code you want to execute on "main.cpp"

5. Build and run
